# Sonic's Fun and Easy Adventure

This is the source code for Sonic's Fun and Easy Adventure. Mainly just here for archival, but feel free to take a gander at it if you like. It's based on an old codebase that I used in 2017, so the code in it, alongside how it's laid out and formatted, is bound to be messy. On top of that, the actual hack itself was rushed in 2 weeks for Sonic Hacking Contest 2017's expo segment, so there's also bound to be buggy and even scrapped code and assets. I did go out of my way to fix the more glaring issues, though.
